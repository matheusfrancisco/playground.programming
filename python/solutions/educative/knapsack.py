Top-down solution
The top-down solution, commonly known as the memoization technique, is an enhancement of the 
recursive solution. It overcomes the problem of calculating redundant solutions over and over again 
by storing them in a table.

In the recursive approach, the two variables that kept changing in each call were the 
total weight of the knapsack and the number of items we had. So, weâ€™ll use these two 
variables to define each distinct subproblem. Therefore, we need a 2-D array to store 
these values and the result of any given subproblem when we encounter it for the first time. 
At any later time, if we encounter the same sub-problem, we can return the stored result from the table with an 
O(1)
 lookup instead of recalculating that subproblem.
