# Backtracking - Additional States


## Additional constraints

In Palindrome Partitioning, we had the constraints that each part of the
partition must be a palindrome. We solved it by checking the validity of a
prefix before branching out. In some cases, the constraints are more imposed
by the problem require us to keep additional states to check the validity of
a branch
