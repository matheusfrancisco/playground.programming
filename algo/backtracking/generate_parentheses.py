"""
Given an integer n, generate all strings with n matching parentheses. "matching" parentheses mean

there is equal number of opening and closing parentheses.
each opening parenthesis has matching closing parentheses.
For example, () is a valid string but )( is not a valid string because ) has no matching parenthesis before it and ( has no matching parenthesis after it.
