4.2.4 Describe what happens if you apply binary search to an unordered array.
Why shouldn't you check whether the array is sorted before each call to binary search?
Could you check that the elements binary search examines are in ascending order? 
If so, would that check be effective?

4.2.18 Analyze mathematically the number of compares that mergesort makes to sort 
an array of length n. For simplicity assume that n is a power of 2.

4.2.2 Develop a nonrecursive implementation of binary search.

4.2.10 Write a filter that reads strings from standard input and prints them 
to standard output, in sorted order with all duplicate strings removed.
